# Security Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. DOMPurify Integrity Hash Mismatch
**Problem**: The SHA384 integrity hash for DOMPurify 3.0.8 in index.html was incorrect, causing the library to fail loading.
**Solution**: Temporarily removed the integrity attribute from the DOMPurify script tag. For production, you should:
- Use SRI Hash Generator (https://www.srihash.org/) to generate the correct hash
- Or get the hash from jsdelivr website directly

### 2. URL Validation Rejecting Relative URLs
**Problem**: The `validateURL()` method in security.js was rejecting all relative URLs like "/models", "/api/genres", causing API calls to fail.
**Solution**: Updated `validateURL()` to:
- Accept relative URLs starting with "/"
- Accept protocol-relative URLs starting with "//"
- Support WebSocket protocols (ws://, wss://)
- Properly validate absolute URLs

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations
**Problem**: Inline styles were being blocked by the strict CSP policy.
**Solution**: Added `'unsafe-inline'` to the style-src directive temporarily.

## Remaining Security Considerations

### 1. DOMPurify Integrity Hash
For production deployment, you should:
1. Generate the correct SHA384 hash for DOMPurify 3.0.8
2. Add it back to the script tag: `integrity="sha384-[correct-hash]"`
3. Or use a different version with a known hash

### 2. Inline Styles Refactoring
The current solution uses `'unsafe-inline'` which weakens CSP. Better approach:
1. Move all inline styles to CSS classes
2. Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP
3. Use CSS variables for dynamic styling

Current inline styles that need refactoring:
- `templates/index.html:45` - parametersContent display
- `templates/index.html:89` - selectedParams styling
- `templates/index.html:128` - typingIndicator display

### 3. Additional Security Enhancements
Consider implementing:
1. Nonce-based CSP for any necessary inline scripts/styles
2. Stricter CORS policies for API endpoints
3. Rate limiting on API endpoints
4. Input validation on all user inputs
5. Regular security audits of dependencies

## Testing the Fixes

After these changes, the application should:
1. Load DOMPurify successfully (check console for no integrity errors)
2. Make API calls without URL validation errors
3. Display UI elements without CSP violations

Test by:
1. Opening browser console (F12)
2. Refreshing the page
3. Checking for no security-related errors
4. Verifying that models load in the dropdown
5. Testing chat functionality
