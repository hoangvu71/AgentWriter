# Multi-Agent Book Writer System

A sophisticated multi-agent system for book writing powered by Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini AI. **All data is automatically persisted to Supabase database for permanent storage and retrieval.**

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Open web interface:** http://localhost:8000

3. **Try example prompt:**
   ```
   Create a fantasy novel, LitRPG, Zombie Apocalypse, survive and family, dark/humour/realistic, Male/Heterosexual/Young Adults. Create author too.
   ```

**✅ All plots and authors are automatically saved to your Supabase database!**

## Multi-Agent Architecture

### **🎯 Orchestrator Agent**
- Routes user requests to appropriate agents
- Coordinates sequential workflows between agents
- Manages inter-agent communication
- Makes intelligent routing decisions based on user intent
- **Logs all decisions to database for analytics**

### **📖 Plot Generator Agent**
- Creates detailed plots based on comprehensive parameters:
  - **Genre**: Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi, Mystery, etc.
  - **Subgenre**: LitRPG, Space Opera, Cozy Mystery, etc.
  - **Microgenre**: Zombie Apocalypse, Time Travel, etc.
  - **Tropes**: Survive and family, Chosen one, etc.
  - **Tone**: Dark, humorous, realistic, etc.
  - **Target Audience**: Age range, sexual orientation, gender
- **Automatically saves all generated plots with metadata**

### **✍️ Author Generator Agent**
- Creates author profiles matching microgenre and target audience:
  - Author name and pen name suggestions
  - Comprehensive biography and background
  - Writing voice and style descriptions
  - Genre expertise and credentials
  - Target audience appeal analysis
- **Links authors to plots and saves to database**

### **🌍 World Building Agent**
- Creates intricate fictional worlds based on plot requirements:
  - Geography, climate, and physical environments
  - Political systems, governments, and power structures
  - Cultural traditions, religions, and social hierarchies
  - Economic systems, trade, and resources
  - Magic systems and supernatural elements (for fantasy)
- **All world building data stored as structured JSONB in database**

### **👥 Characters Agent**
- Develops detailed character populations for stories:
  - Primary protagonists with complete character arcs
  - Supporting characters with defined roles and relationships
  - Antagonists with clear motivations and backgrounds
  - Character relationship networks and dynamics
  - Character development trajectories throughout the story
- **Links characters to both plots and world building contexts**

## 🗄️ Database Persistence (✅ Fully Operational)

### Current Database Schema:
1. **users** - User management and tracking
2. **sessions** - Chat session persistence  
3. **plots** - Generated plot data with normalized foreign keys
4. **authors** - Author profiles (can have multiple plots)
5. **world_building** - Fictional world details with JSONB data structures
6. **characters** - Character populations and relationship networks
7. **orchestrator_decisions** - AI routing analytics
8. **genres** - Genre definitions with descriptions
9. **subgenres** - Subgenre categories linked to genres
10. **microgenres** - Microgenre types linked to subgenres
11. **tropes** - Story tropes linked to microgenres
12. **tones** - Tone variations linked to tropes
13. **target_audiences** - Audience demographics and interests
14. **improvement_sessions** - Iterative content enhancement tracking
15. **improvement_iterations** - Individual critique/enhancement cycles

### What Gets Saved Automatically:
- ✅ **Every plot** with complete genre metadata
- ✅ **Every author** linked to their plots
- ✅ **World building details** with structured geography, politics, culture
- ✅ **Character populations** with relationships and development arcs
- ✅ **User sessions** for conversation tracking
- ✅ **AI decisions** for system improvement
- ✅ **Improvement iterations** with critique and enhancement cycles
- ✅ **Searchable history** of all creations

**📖 See `docs/database_documentation.md` for complete schema details.**

}
```

## Development

The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. **Write tests first** - All functionality starts with failing tests
2. **Keep it simple** - No overengineering or unnecessary complexity  
3. **Ask for clarification** - Never assume requirements
4. **Focus on root causes** - Fix core issues, not symptoms
5. **Multi-agent design** - Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
6. **Database-first** - All data automatically persisted

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Database Security
- ✅ Secure Supabase connection with SSL
- ✅ Environment variable protection
- ✅ Row Level Security ready for production

### Performance Features
- **🔄 Streaming**: Real-time response streaming
- **⚡ Async Processing**: Concurrent agent execution  
- **🎯 Smart Routing**: Intelligent model selection
- **💾 Auto-Save**: Immediate database persistence
- **🔍 Fast Retrieval**: Indexed database queries

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication errors**: Ensure Google Cloud credentials are properly configured
2. **Database connection issues**: Run `python test_database.py` to verify connectivity
3. **Port 8000 in use**: Kill existing process or use different port
4. **Migration failed**: Check Supabase CLI login with `npx supabase projects list`
5. **WebSocket disconnections**: Check network connectivity and firewall settings

## 📚 Documentation

- **📖 `docs/database_documentation.md`** - Complete database schema and API reference
- **⚙️ `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed setup and configuration guide
- **🔄 `migrations/README.md`** - Database migration system guide

## Contributing

1. Follow the TDD approach outlined in `CLAUDE.md`
2. Write tests for all new functionality
